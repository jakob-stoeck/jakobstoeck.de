My technical background is in creating and operating large-scale web/mobile/server applications with hundreds of millions of users. I have extensive experience building and managing high-performance teams, and consider myself a fan of agile development practices and the lean startup movement. I founded and ran the startup Pokermania with 30 people for 4 years. Afterwards, in the last 15 years, my roles have been Director of Engineering for Sport1, SinnerSchrader/part of Accenture Interactive, ask me about some fun side-gigs in Amazon Music and VR companies, and for the last 3+ years Head of Engineering at Grab in Southeast Asia.
